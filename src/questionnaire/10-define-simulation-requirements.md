## Guidance
   You review your objectives and plan out how you want to teach the
    concept so that learning is achieved to the desired level. You may
    want to refer the pedagogy model prescribed here. Consider how
    you want your students to interact with the experiement, what
    controls they are offered (or not offered), what information
    you want to collect about their interaction (so that you can use
    it later to evaluate the effectiveness of the experiment, as well
    as engagement level of the student). Depending on the learning
    level targeted, you have to provide more, or less, flexibility
    to the students in controlling the inputs and steps of the
    experiment. Use the questions to trigger your thinking. Also this
    is a good point to review existing experiment and also talk to a
    simulation designer or digital instructional designer or UX
    specialist. Also refer to the guidance in the Simulation step.

## Sample
   **Question 1** : What are the requirements of the
                   experiments used to develop the experiment
                   simulation?
    
   **Answer 1** : There are 4 primitives that the
                        simulation provides - index, compare,
                        split, merge.  These primitives are
                        applied to a given input (array of
                        numbers for example).  The steps
                        followed by the student are recorded
                        and played back.


   **Question 2** : What scenarios, other than the normal
                   experiment process, are executed in the
                   experiment?

   **Answer 2** : Student selects different types of
                        input arrays.
    
   **Question 3** : What are the data points that need to be
                   collected from the experiment?

   **Answer 3** : For each experiment, student captures
                        the result of the operation (split or
                        merge) and counts the number of
                        operations from the records.

   **Question 4** : What flexibility is offered to the student
                   in order to control the experiment?

   **Answer 4** : Student chooses the input array.  The
                        student also chooses the primitive to
                        be applied to the input.  In case of
                        error, the simulation provides a
                        clear message and a hint to overcome
                        the error.
