## Guidance

   A Learning Objective is statement that describes the specific
     knowledge or skills that the student needs to acquire and is able
     to demonstrate. A good learning objective uses a verb that
     relates to what is learned, and an action verb to relate to what
     is observed or demonstrated.

   An example of the learning objective would be :
    
   At the end of this lesson, the student is able to perform
     the experiment on Data Structures with confidence and
     accuracy.

   Here, skill acquired is the ability to perform an experiment and
     demonstrable skill is to perform them accurately and confidently.
     If confidence and accuracy can't be observed, objective needs to
     be refined further and uses different ways of observing.
     
   There are many ways of defining learning objectives, see [Mager's tips of instructional objectives](http://www2.gsu.edu/~mstmbs/CrsTools/Magerobj.html), 
    and the tool [objective builder](https://cdl.ucf.edu/teach/resources/objective-builder-tool)

## Questions and Answers

   **Question 1** : What is a comprehensive and lucid
                  statement of what the student is able
                  to learn and demonstrate at the end of the
                  experiment?
    
   **Answer 1** : At the end of the experiment, student will be
        able to sort any given unsorted array using merge sort. They
        will also be able to demonstrate the order of complexity
        calculation of the algorithm and apply merge sort in right
        real-world problem.
