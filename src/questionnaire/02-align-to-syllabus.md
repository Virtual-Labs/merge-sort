## Guidance
   The experiment content is checked for alignment
   against these factors:

   1. Which university/college curriculum is it aligned to?

   2. How well is the subject and curriculum of the experiment
        aligned with topics in the university curriculum?

   3. How well is the objective aligned?

   4. How well is the model and concept of the experiment aligned
        with what the curriculum specifies for the experiment?

   5. How well are the evaluation and metrics aligned?

## Questions and Answers

   **Question 5** : Provide _links_ to universities' syllabus
                    (course) where your experiment is listed
                    as a topic and _aligned_ with the curriculum?

   **Answer 5** : IIIT Hyderabad, [Data Structures](https://www.iiit.ac.in/academics/curriculum/undergraduate/cse)

   **Question 6** : How do you _align_ your experiment with
                    [[ http://www.celt.iastate.edu/teaching/effective-teaching-practices/revised-blooms-taxonomy][Bloom's Taxonomy]]?

   **Answer 6** : For 'Recall' (level 1), we will help break the
                  theory into easy-to-remember points.  Also the
                  experiments always end with key takeaways, for
                  'Understanding' (level 2).  We use animation to show
                  the steps followed in the sorting process and let
                  them repeat it as many times as they want.  We also
                  introduce questions in the experiment flow to
                  reiterate learning and point to key aspects. For
                  'Apply' (level 3), we let the students practice with
                  different data sets and also let them perform the
                  experiment in the way they want to. For 'Evaluating'
                  (level 5), we provide situations (arrays of
                  different sizes, different types of data, etc.)
                  where they need to select the right sorting
                  algorithm.
