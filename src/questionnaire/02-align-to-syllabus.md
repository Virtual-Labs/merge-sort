## Guidance
   The experiment content is checked for alignment
   against these factors:

   1. Which university/college curriculum is it aligned to?

   2. How well is the subject and curriculum of the experiment
        aligned with topics in the university curriculum?

   3. How well is the objective aligned?

   4. How well is the model and concept of the experiment aligned
        with what the curriculum specifies for the experiment?

   5. How well are the evaluation and metrics aligned?

## Questions and Answers

   **Question 1** : Provide the links to universities' syllabus
                    (course) where your experiment is listed as a
                    topic and aligned with the syllabus.

   **Answer 1** : IIIT Hyderabad, [Data Structures](https://www.iiit.ac.in/academics/curriculum/undergraduate/cse)

   **Question 2** : How do you align your experiment with
                     Bloom's Taxonomy?

   **Answer 2** : For 'Recall' (level 1), we will help break
                  the theory into easy-to-remember points.  Also the
                  experiments always end with key takeaways, for
                  'Understanding' (level 2).  We use animation to show the
                  steps followed in the sorting process and let them repeat it
                  as many times as they want.  We also introduce questions
                  in the experiment flow to reiterate learning and point to key
                  aspects. For 'Apply' (level 3), we let the students
                  practice with different data sets and also let them perform
                  the experiment in the way they want to.
