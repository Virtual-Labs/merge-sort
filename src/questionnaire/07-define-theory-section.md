## Guidance
   The theory is the knowledge base on which the other sections of
    the experiment depend on.  Hence all knowledge related to the
    context, the performance of the experiment, constraints and
    exceptions are present in this part.

   This includes the following:

   1. Theory related to the concept being taught in the experiment.
    2. Pre-requisites for understanding the experiment.
    3. Deeper theory that is known only to the above average students.
    4. Theoritical information aligned to the learning level that is
       targeted by the experiement.
    5. Other references and related reads that will help the learner
       comprehend the concept.

   Theory is also interspersed with questions that aids the
    understanding of the theory.  These are similar to the pre-test
    questions in many cases and they can be reused.

## Questions and Answers
   **Question 13** :  What is the _content and explanation_
                     written to relate and understand the
                     principles of the experiment?
    
   **Answer 13** : Basics of a few sorting algorithms like Insertion
                  Sort and Heap Sort are described in first page to
                  reorient the student to sorting algorithms.  Need
                  for an efficient algorithm is established, and
                  principles of merge sort are explained in next 3
                  paragraphs.  Diagram 1 shows how merge sort operates
                  in a step by step manner. Page 2 is devoted to
                  explaining order of complexity of sorting algorithms
                  and of merge sort. Diagram 2 shows why merge sort
                  has O(nlogn) complexity.


   **Question 14** : What are the pre-requisites for doing
                    this experiment?
    
   **Answer 14** : Student should be able to understand the concept of
                  ordering, and knows at least one sorting algorithm
                  before. Student should have been introduced to the
                  concept of order of complexity of an algorithm.
    
   **Question 15** : What are references and related reading
                    included in this section?

   **Answer 15** :  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort][Wikipedia intro]] 
                         [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELiBnWGrxsE][Animation of merge sort example]]
