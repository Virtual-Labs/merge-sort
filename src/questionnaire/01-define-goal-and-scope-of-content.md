
## Guidance
   Create an overview of the concept and the scope of the
   experiment. This needs you to include the following:

   **Goal** : What needs to be learned?

   **Learning level** : How much needs to be learned? You
                        may use Bloom's Taxonomy.

   **Learning Objectives and Outcomes** : Specifics of what needs
                                          to be learned and observable 
                                          outcomes to evaluate whether
                                          learning has happened.

   **Instructional Design** : How is the content going to be
                              designed so that it promotes 
                              learning through efficiency,
                              effectiness and appeal to the learner?

   **Pedagogy** : What procedure of teaching is
                  applied? Also ensure that you have
                  reviewed the recommended pedagogy and
                  are adhering to it.

## Questions and Answers
   **Question 1** : What does the student learn from the
                    experiment?

   **Answer 1** : Student learns about merge sort, how
                  it works and time complexity of the
                  algorithm. Student is able to differentiate 
                  between different sorting algorithms and 
                  be able to choose merge sort usage when 
                  required and apply it to the real-world problem 
                  like sorting the PAN card numbers of people in a 
                  district.

   **Question 2** : Till which level of Bloom's Taxonomy
                    the experiment addresses learning?

   **Answer 2** : Student reaches level 3 of Bloom's Taxonomy -
                  "Apply".  Students understand the concept 
                  (level 2) as well as apply their knowledge 
                  to a given sorting problem.

   **Question 3** : How is the content designed
                    so that it promotes learning?

   **Answer 3** : Merrill's [first principles](http://mdavidmerrill.com/Papers/firstprinciplesbymerrill.pdf) of
                  instruction design is applied.  We use real-world
                  problems and leverage existing knowledge of sorting
                  to teach merge sort. We use animation to
                  demonstrate concepts and let the student use merge
                  sort process by experimenting with it.

   **Question 4** : What procedure of teaching is applied?

   **Answer 4** : We apply the pedagogy as described in this
                  document.
