
## Guidance
   Create an overview of the concept and the scope of the
   experiment. This needs you to include the following:

   **Goal** : What needs to be learned?

   **Learning level** : How much needs to be learned? You
                        may use Bloom's Taxonomy.

   **Learning Objectives and Outcomes** : Specifics of what needs
                                          to be learned and observable 
                                          outcomes to evaluate whether
                                          learning has happened.

   **Instructional Design** : How is the content going to be
                              designed so that it promotes 
                              learning through efficiency,
                              effectiness and appeal to the learner?

   **Pedagogy** : What procedure of teaching is
                  applied? Also ensure that you have
                  reviewed the recommended pedagogy and
                  are adhering to it.

## Questions and Answers
   **Question 1** : How will you _summarize_ and state the
                    objective of the experiment in a
                    _comprehensive manner_?

   **Answer 1** : Student understands how merge sort works, and is
                  able to explain the algorithm to others.Student is
                  able to apply merge sort when given an array of
                  numbers.  They are able to differentiate between
                  different sorting algorithms and are able to choose
                  right situation to apply merge sort.  Student is
                  able to apply merge sort to a real-world problem
                  like sorting the marks of all students in an
                  entrance exam.

   **Question 2** : State how the scope defined for the
                     experiment ensures that the content
                     enhances _understanding_ of the
                     student?

   **Answer 2** : Theory section explains merge sort with an example,
                  and also includes questions to reiterate the
                  learning. Simulation shows it merge sort in action
                  using animation, and also tests their understanding
                  by letting them try out the merge sort with an
                  example.

   **Question 3** : What are the aspects that need _application_ of
                    understanding in the experiment?

   **Answer 3** : Simulation includes exercises where student is asked
                  to run merge sort experiment on their own and record
                  their observations. Student is also asked to correct
                  errors in a given merge sort example and thereby
                  apply their understanding of the algorithm.


   **Question 4** : Explain how to _evaluate_ the performance of the
                     student in the experiment.

   **Answer 4** : Evaluation is made through quiz at the end of the
                  experiment, exercises within the simulation, as well
                  as questions asked within the theory section.
