## Guidance
   These are quiz questions that are asked at appropriate places in
    the theory to reinforce learning and also to evaluate how well the
    student understands the theory. Asking questions at the right
    place in reading flow is important, so do take special care in
    defining the position in the theory where a particular question is
    asked.

## Sample

   **Question 16** : What are the questions that will be
                    interspersed in the theory section in
                    order to _evaluate_ the _understanding_
                    of the student while going through the
                    content?
    
   **Answer 16** : Questions like the ones listed
        below will be asked to the student in the Theory
        Section

     This is asked at the end of Insertion sort section

     Insertion sort has time complexity of
                
     1. O(n)
     2. O(nlogn)
     3. O(n^2)
     4. None of these
                
    This is asked at the end of HeapSort section

    Best case time complexity of heap sort is O(nlogn)
     1. False
     2. True
                
   **Question 17** : Have you provided the position within the theory
                    where the question is asked?
  
   **Answer 17** : Questions will be asked at the end of Insertion sort
                   section and HeapSort section.
