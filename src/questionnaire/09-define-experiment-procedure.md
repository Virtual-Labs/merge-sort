## Guidance
   The Procedure section has a dominant role in the effectiveness of
    the experiment.  The objectives, outcomes and the value add is
    built into the procedure.  Since this also forms the basis on
    which the simulation section of the experiment is developed, the
    core value add is embedded in this section.
