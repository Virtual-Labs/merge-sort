* Pedagogy Mapping Checklist 

  The following questions form the Pedagogy mapping
  checklist.  This enables you to verify the compliance of
  your proposed experiment with the prescribed pedagogy
  structure.  Example answers to each question (with
  reference to merge sort experiment ) is also included
  below each question.
