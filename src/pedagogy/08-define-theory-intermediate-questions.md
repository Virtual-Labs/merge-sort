## Guidance
   These are quiz questions that are asked at appropriate places in
    the theory to reinforce learning and also to evaluate how well the
    student understands the theory. Asking questions at the right
    place in reading flow is important, so do take special care in
    defining the position in the theory where a particular question is
    asked.

## Sample

   **Question 1** : Have you identified and listed the questions that
                    you ask the student while he is going through the
                    theory section?
    
   **Answer 2** : Yes (sample question below) (This is asked at
        the end of Insertion sort section) Insertion sort has time
        complexity of               
                a) O(n)
                b) O(nlogn)
                c) O(n^2)
                d) None of these
                
   (This is asked after HeapSort section)
                Best case time complexity of heap sort is O(nlogn)
                a) True
                b) False
                
   **Question 2** : Have you provided the position within the theory where
                  the question is asked?
  
   **Answer 2** :  Yes
