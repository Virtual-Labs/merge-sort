## Guidance
   This is a student assessment test to evaluate the understanding of
    the student prior to performing the experiment. This is also used
    while formulating the final assessment at the end of the
    experiment. Answers of these questions help in understanding
    baseline knowledge of the student and in checking learning gains
    when used along with final ssessment.

   Following types of assessments are included:

   All pretest questions are Single or Multiple Choice Questions so
    that it is easy to assess and provide immediate feedback.

## Questions and Answers
   **Question 1** : Have you included questions to understand student's expectation from the
