 # Step 1 : Define Goal and Scope of Content  
## Questionnaire
     ** Question ** : What does the student learn from the
                    experiment?

     **Question 2** : Till which level of Bloom's Taxonomy
                      the experiment addresses learning?

     **Question 3** : How is the content designed so that it promotes
                      learning?

     **Question 4** : What procedure of teaching is applied?

## Guidance
    Create an overview of the concept and the scope of the
    experiment. This needs you to include the following:

    1. **Goal** : What needs to be learned?

    2. **Learning level** : How much needs to be learned? You
                            may use Bloom's Taxonomy.

    3. **Learning Objectives and Outcomes** : Specifics of what needs
                                              to be learned and observable 
                                              outcomes to evaluate whether
                                              learning has happened.

    4. **Instructional Design** : How is the content going to be
                                  designed so that it promotes 
                                  learning through efficiency,
                                  effectiness and appeal to the learner?

    5. **Pedagogy** : What procedure of teaching is
                      applied? Also ensure that you have
                      reviewed the recommended pedagogy and
                      are adhering to it.

## Questions and Answers
    **Question 1** : What does the student learn from the
                     experiment?

    **Answer 1** : Student learns about merge sort, how
                   it works and time complexity of the
                   algorithm. Student is able to differentiate 
                   between different sorting algorithms and 
                   be able to choose merge sort usage when 
                   required and apply it to the real-world problem 
                   like sorting the PAN card numbers of people in a 
                   district.

    **Question 2** : Till which level of Bloom's Taxonomy
                     the experiment addresses learning?

    **Answer 2** : Student reaches level 3 of Bloom's Taxonomy -
                   "Apply".  Students understand the concept 
                   (level 2) as well as apply their knowledge 
                   to a given sorting problem.

    **Question 3** : How is the content designed
                     so that it promotes learning?

    **Answer 3** : Merrill's [first principles](http://mdavidmerrill.com/Papers/firstprinciplesbymerrill.pdf) of
                   instruction design is applied.  We use real-world
                   problems and leverage existing knowledge of sorting
                   to teach merge sort. We use animation to
                   demonstrate concepts and let the student use merge
                   sort process by experimenting with it.

    **Question 4** : What procedure of teaching is applied?

    **Answer 4** : We apply the pedagogy as described in this
                   document.
