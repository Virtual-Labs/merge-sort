## Guidance
   The Procedure section has a dominant role in the effectiveness of
    the experiment.  The objectives, outcomes and the value add is
    built into the procedure.  Since this also forms the basis on
    which the simulation section of the experiment is developed, the
    core value add is embedded in this section.

   **Answer 18** : The students execute the steps listed
                         below to perform the experiment
  
                         1. Pick an array to sort.
                         2. Click on 'split' to split into 2

                         3. Follow the step for each
                            resultant array and repeat till
                            you can't split it anymore.
                         4. Drag one array on the other to merge
                         5. Keep repeating till you get a
                            final array of same size as the
                            original array.
                         6. You have the sorted array
