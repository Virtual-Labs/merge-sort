## Guidance
     
   Guidance of pre-test section applies here as well. Also, note that depending
     on the learning level your experiment is adhering to, some of the questions
     may not be applicable. For example, if the experiment is focused on understanding
     (level 2), question about 'apply' (level 3) is not applicable.
